Currently messing around with a FLOSS knowledge graph project called [ligature](https://ligature.dev).
It's still under heavy development, but see the [website](https://ligature.dev) and pinned repos for more info.
Right now I'm mostly focusing on Scala, F# (backend/frontend) and TypeScript (frontend) but also have a couple of Rust projects up my sleeve.
