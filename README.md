I'm currently working on a FLOSS knowledge graph project called [ligature](https://ligature.dev).
It's still under heavy development, but see the [website](https://ligature.dev) and pinned repos for more info.
Right now I'm mostly focusing on Rust code but I also have an interest in F#, Scala, TypeScript, and Kotlin.
