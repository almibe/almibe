I'm currently working on a FLOSS knowledge graph project called [Ligature](https://ligature.dev) and a scripting language called [Wander](https://wander-lang.dev).
They are both still under heavy development, but see the websites and pinned repos for more info.
Right now I'm mostly focusing on Rust code but I also have an interest in F#, Scala, TypeScript, and Kotlin.
